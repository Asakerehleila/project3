               <P>
                  The first material used for clothing is the natural fibres obtained from both plants and animal sources. These
                  include cotton, flax, wool, leather, silk, etc.
                  The first plant fibres used for extracting fibres are from flax seeds. Flax fibres are 36,000 years old. China was
                  the first country to start with silk production, which was between 5000 and 3000 BC, where silk was extracted
                  from the cocoon of the domesticated silkworm and weaved.
                  The Evolution of clothing and textiles from the animalâ€™s skin and plant materials is vast and colourful. Along with
                  different cultures, different varieties of clothes appeared. Different types of fibres have their history.
                  Cotton was cultivated in Pakistan about 3,000 BC. Wool was being woven about 4,000 BC in Egypt. Nylon, an
                  artificial fibre was invented in the year 1935, which was used as a replacement for silk.
